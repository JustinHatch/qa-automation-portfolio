# QA Automation Portfolio

This project showcases a collection of beginner-to-intermediate automated UI and API tests written in Python using Playwright and Pytest.

Each test targets a specific use case such as login, form validation, element navigation, broken images, and basic API authentication. Screenshots are included for visual proof of each passing test.

Code was written manually with the help of modern AI-assisted development tools to streamline scripting and debugging. All tests were reviewed and verified for accuracy.
